Story of Iqbal Masih

Iqbal Masih was born in 1983 in Muridke, a commercial city outside of Lahore in Punjab, Pakistan, into a poor Christian family.
At age four, he was put to work by his family to pay off their debts.Iqbal's family borrowed money from a man called Hussain Khan who owned a carpet weaving business.
In return, Iqbal was required to work as a carpet weaver until the debt was paid off.

At the age of 10, Iqbal escaped his slavery.
He then went to the police to report Hussain, but the police brought him back to Hussain.
Iqbal escaped a second time and he attended the Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF) School for former child slaves and quickly completed a four-year education in only two years.
Iqbal then helped many Pakistani children that were in bonded labour to escape to freedom and made speeches about child labour throughout the world.

In 1994 he received the Reebok Human Rights Award in Boston and in his acceptance speech he said,
"I am one of those millions of children who are suffering in Pakistan through bonded labour and child labour, 
                but I am lucky that due to the efforts of Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF), I go out in freedom I am standing in front of you here today."
   "After my freedom, I joined BLLF School and I am studying in that school now. For us slave children, Ehsan Khan and BLLF have done the same work that Abraham Lincoln did for the slaves of America."
                                       "Today, you are free and I am free too."
                                       
On 16 April 1995, Iqbal was shot and passed away. He was only 12 years old at that time, but his actions led to the creation of many organisations and charities that 
worked towards the eradication of child bonding and child labor.
